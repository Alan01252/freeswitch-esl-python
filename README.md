# FreeSWITCH ESL Python

This is a Python package to distribute the ESL.py module generated by FreeSWITCH. 

It's an auto-generated SWIG module and the idea is to make it easy to use the FreeSWITCH Event Socket Library without having to install it in the same box. This way you can have different servers, one running FreeSWITCH and another one running your business logic or you can also distribute your tests in a SaaS like Codeship.

## Installing

```shell
$ pip install FreeSWITCH-ESL-Python
```

## Checking version

```shell
$ pip freeze | grep ESL
```

Should return something like `FreeSWITCH-ESL-Python==1.2`.

## Importing

```python
from freeswitchESL import ESL
```

## Redundancy

```python
try:
    import ESL
except ImportError:
    from freeswitchESL import ESL
```

Redundancy could be helpful when you have FreeSWITCH running with your system in production environments, in a way you can just import default ESL package, but you also have a test environment (E.g. Codeship) without a FreeSWITCH installation.

## Building

```shell
$ cd swig
$ swig -module ESL -classic -python -c++ -DMULTIPLICITY -threads -I../include -o esl_wrap.cpp ESL.i
$ mv ESL.py ../freeswitchESL/ESL.py
```
